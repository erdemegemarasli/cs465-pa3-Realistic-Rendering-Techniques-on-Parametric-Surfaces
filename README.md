# Assignment
In this assignment, you will write a program to draw parametric surfaces (superquadric objects - superquadric toroid, and superquadric hyperboloid of one piece) in wireframe, Gouraud Shaded (per vertex shader), or Phong Shaded (per fragment shader) form, depending on the users choice. The user should be able to specify the size of the object using a suitable interface, like specifying with a bounding box and the exponents determining the shape of the object. Your user interface should have the functionality of camera control (rotation, zoom in/out, etc.)

You will implement the functions to display the surfaces in wireframe, Gouraud shaded and Phong shaded form. You will also use per vertex shader for Gouraud Shading and per fragment shader for Phong Shading. You will also select the one of the following three realistic rendering techniques and implement it as part of the assignment:

Parametric Texture Mapping
Bump Mapping
Environment Mapping
Prepare at least two images of the objects with these techniques applied demonstrating the technique that you implemented.
